# Microscope Light Ring

This light ring is designed for use on a Bausch + Lomb Stereo View 7 microscope. It's mounted with a modified version of the part found here: http://transistor-man.com/bausch_lomb_microscope_light.html

The 555 timer configuration was found here:

The mosfet configuration was found here: https://diyodemag.com/education/fundamentals_versatile_555_timer_pwm_control

As of right now, it's still in its prototyping phase and you probably shouldn't make one.
